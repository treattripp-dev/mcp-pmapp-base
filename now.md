## Current Objective
Optimize "Execute" button to use MCP Sampling instead of spawning new processes.

## Status
- [x] Initial Research: Identified `CreateMessageRequest` in SDK.
- [x] **Double Check Research**: Confirmed `SamplingMessageSchema` exists in SDK types.
- [x] **Plan Update**: Refined `implementation_plan.md` to include fallback mechanism.
- [x] **Execution**: Modified `server.js` with Sampling and Fallback.
- [/] **Verification**: Verify functionality.

## Recent Activity
- Created `implementation_plan.md`.
- Received user feedback to research thoroughly before changing code.
